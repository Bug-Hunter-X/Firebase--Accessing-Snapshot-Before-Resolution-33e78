This repository demonstrates a common error in Firebase when working with asynchronous operations and document snapshots. The `bug.js` file showcases the problematic code that attempts to access snapshot data before the promise has resolved, causing unexpected behavior. The `bugSolution.js` file shows a corrected version using `.then()` to handle the asynchronous nature of Firebase operations.
